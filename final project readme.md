### Files and Directories

- `top 100 youtube project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and code.
- `youtube data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis (loaded in the notebook).

### Notebook Sections

1. **Introduction**:
   - Provides an overview of the analysis.
   - Describes the objective: exploring YouTube channel rankings, subscriber counts, and more.

2. **Data Loading**:
   - Loads the `youtube data.csv` file using pandas.
   - Displays the dataset structure, including columns and data types.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handles missing or inconsistent values.
   - Ensures the dataset is ready for analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizes trends, distributions, and correlations within the data.
   - Key metrics include subscriber counts, total views, and rankings.

5. **Insights and Conclusions**:
   - Summarizes findings from the analysis.
   - Highlights trends such as top-performing categories or regions.

6. **Visualizations**:
   - Includes plots and graphs created using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

7. **Exporting Results**:
   - Saves processed data or visualizations for further use.

## How to Use

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Install Python (version 3.7 or higher).
   - Install required libraries:

     ```bash

     ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook "top 100 youtube project.ipynb"
     ```

   - Execute each cell sequentially to replicate the analysis.

3. **Modify or Extend**:
   - Add new visualizations or analysis steps.
   - Replace the dataset with updated YouTube data to analyze newer trends.
